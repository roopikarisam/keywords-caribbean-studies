What does it mean to bring the terms queer and Caribbean together? We use this question as a critical site of orientation because it has generated such debate within Caribbean studies. Queer is a difficult word to define partly because its slipperiness –whether codified as a noun, adjective or verb – is a hallmark of its very meaning. Queer can be used to denote non-normative practices and identities of gender and sexuality. It can gesture to possibilities that are only imagined or on the horizon. It can index a radical project of deconstructing existing social orders. Conversely, it may also operate as a vehicle for reinforcing dominant relations of power (e.g. US  homonationalism). And there are others. The indeterminacy of queerness allows Caribbean studies to revisit the ways the Caribbean has also always existed as a site of discursive struggle, multiplicity, and contingency. Its borders have always been unstable and its sovereignty and meanings fraught.

How does bringing queerness and Caribbean together unsettle the ways they have each been conceptualized and mobilized? As a critical and political term, “queer” emerged in a North Atlantic context and became institutionalized in academic settings in the 1980s and 1990s. Bringing Caribbean studies to bear on Queer studies unsettles its North Atlantic-centricity in at least two ways. First, it compels an engagement with other geographies and cultural terrains. In this way, it opens up a consideration of how queerness takes shape in and through global relations of power. What does queerness look like through the intimacies of empire but also through the critical and political formations of postcolonialism, neo-colonialism and homonationalism? What does queerness – as sexuality, as possibility, as deconstruction, as normativity – look like in the Caribbean? In what ways are these iterations of queerness relevant to Caribbean studies? Second, it offers an opportunity to think through the intertwined politics and mobilities of language and space. Caribbean scholars in anthropology, cultural and popular studies, and literary studies have reminded us that there have also always been vernacular ways of naming the non-normative practices and possibilities of Caribbean intimacies, gender and sexualities. How do we reconcile these names, epistemologies, and practices with global itineraries of "queer"? And the ways they travel and interact with each other across and within different nodes of relation?

Conversely, what insights might Queer studies have to offer Caribbean studies? Such an exchange is potentially generative because both fields are oriented toward interdisciplinarity and intellectual promiscuity. Queer studies may offer additional methodological tools to address key concerns in Caribbean studies like experimentation in literary form, the problem of historical representation, and critical approaches to frameworks of development. For instance, in the realm of history, we might combine the path breaking work of Kamau Brathwaite with more recent scholarship on queer historiography to question the political utility of recuperating queer Caribbean subjects. If Faith Smith maintains that “by virtue of being indigenous, African or Asian, and even by residing in the tropics, one is probably already marked as deviant, queer, or perverse,”[^1] then a specific project of recuperation in some ways becomes moot. The project becomes not about excavating new (old?) subjects but re-orienting our frameworks to recognize the Caribbean’s inherent challenge to colonial modernity and Victorian norms of respectability. In this context, the oft-recited narrative of Caribbean homophobia is revealed to be less about the realities of the region itself and more about how queer violence is mobilized as a stand in for projected fantasies and imaginaries of excess. (This is not to deny the very real violence that queer subjects experience in the Caribbean but to point out how narratives of such violence limit the capacity to envision the region otherwise.)

We have chosen five artifacts to gesture to the different ways of thinking about the intersection/relationship between Caribbean studies and Queer studies. In highlighting the work of the Audre Lorde Project, the drag performance of Lola Von Miramar, the queer Caribbean Visualities project, the Caribbean International Resource Network, and the art and activism of Assotto Saint, our curation involves a consideration of the following: 1) the linguistic diversity of the region; 2) the ways queer Caribbean life has always traced a bridge beyond the Caribbean sea, and; 3) the diverse forms of archiving and creative practices: writing, visual arts, performance and their relationship to community and social justice work in which Caribbean queer subjects have been engaged.

**Curatorial Note:** Assotto Saint’s body of writing is still understudied and underappreciated. He was a Haitian born poet playwright and activist who died in June 1994, aged 38, but who left behind a remarkable body of work. Much of his work was collected in the volume *Spells of a Voodoo Doll* which includes his poetry, drama, fiction, essays, song lyrics and the obituaries that he wrote for comrades who had died at the height of the HIV/AIDS crisis. He also edited the anthology *The Road Before Us: 100 Gay Black Poets* in 1991. The biographical note about Saint that we include here is from the extensive Black queer archive, _The Ubuntu Biography Project_, which was curated and edited by Stephen A. Maglott up until his death in 2016. *The Ubuntu Biography Project* also includes entries on Caribbean figures like Staceyann Chin, Nalo Hopkinson, Godfrey Sealy, G. Winston James, Cheryl Boyce Taylor, Thomas Glave , Topher Campbell, June Jordan, Claude McKay and others.
